# Aspect Oriented Programming

Aspect Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm where the cross-cutting concerns are separated from the business logic. 

1. Aspect Oriented Programming allows us to code business logic and cross-cutting concerns separately. 
2. We can link the cross-cutting concerns to the business logic either through xml files or through annotations.
